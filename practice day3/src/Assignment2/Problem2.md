class WatchPriceCalculator{
  double getWatchPrice(String watchType, int age, String gender){
    //code to computer and return the price of watch up to two decimal places
  }
}

public class WatchPriceTester {
  public static void main(String args[]){
    WatchPriceCalculator wcOne = new WatchPriceCalculator();

    //for watch type = Titan, gender = "female", age = 25
    System.out.println(wcOne.getWatchPrice("Titan", 25, "female"));

    //for watch type = Rolex, gender = "male", age = 65
    System.out.println(wcOne.getWatchPrice("Rolex", 65, "male"));

    //for watch type = Rolex, gender = "female", age = 61
    System.out.println(wcOne.getWatchPrice("Rolex", 61, "female"));
