### Question-1

Write a program to input an array of N X N size (i.e. it is square matrix) then find the difference of sum of diagonal elements.

Sample Input
Enter Size of matrix: 4
Enter elements of matrix:
1 2 3 4
5 6 3 1
7 1 2 3
5 8 4 6

Sample Output
The difference of sum of diagonal is 2

Explanation
The addition of elements of first diagonal is 1 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 15
The addition of elements of second diagonal is 5 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 13
The difference of 15 â€“ 13 is 2
